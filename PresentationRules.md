# Bussiness Problem
- - Your company now sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies.
- - You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.
- - You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of your company's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
